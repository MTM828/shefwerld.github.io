            <p>Shef Kerbi's Apparel, as the world's greatest and one of the only online clothing stores out there is determined to make the customer purchase experience better and faster than your standard retail store. That's why we have introduced three methods of how you can have your goods delivered:</p>
            <div id="seperator"></div>
            <h2>Same Second Shipping</h2>
            <p>Same Second Shipping was introduced since we've determined that the average attention span of a person is lower than one minute, so we created this service for some amount of instant gratification. For this merch, just wait a second, and then look at the picture and now you've got the merch.</p>
            <div id="seperator"></div>
            <h2>Predictive Shipping</h2>
            <p>We use a combination of browser cookies, mind reading appartuses and telekinesis to predict what you'll buy, and we'll being delivering it before you've clicked on Submit. You may receive your merch a fraction of a second before you click on the Purchase button, so you have to do no waiting at all to get your merch.</p>
            <div id="seperator"></div>
            <h2>Very Predictive Shipping</h2>
            <p>Very Predicitve Shipping is a more advanced version of Predictive Shipping. On Monday morning, we'll use the 600 000 trackers we have on you to determine what you're going to buy for the week, and if you lack funds, we'll secretly ship you the required amount of money through stealthy methods. Once you decide to buy a Shef Kerbi Apparel item, we'll throw that item into your house immediately.</p>
